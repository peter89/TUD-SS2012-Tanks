<title>The acm.io Package</title>
</head>
<body>
This package includes two classes that simplify I/O operations.
The first is <a href="IOConsole.html"><code><b>IOConsole</b></code></a>, which provides
a traditional interactive console.
The second is <a href="IODialog.html"><code><b>IODialog</b></code></a>, which
provides a dialog-based input mechanism that is compatible with the console
design.
Each of these classes implements the <a href="IOModel.html"><code><b>IOModel</b></code></a>
interface, which unifies the two input models.
